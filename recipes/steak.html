    <h3>The day you learned to cook a perfect steak.</h3>
    <p>It all starts with the <strong>quality of the steak</strong>. The rest is really simple.</p>
    <p>By <em>quality</em>, we mean the following. The more boxes you check, the better the odds of success even before you enter the kitchen</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Steak source (butcher shop over supermarket)</li>
        <li>Steak size (thickness not lower than 2-3 inch)</li>
        <li>Steak type (tenderness and smoothness)</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li>Steak (duh!)</li>
        <li>Cooking oil & butter</li>
        <li>2-3 pods of peeled garlic</li>
        <li>1 bayleaf</li>

        <li>Add some oil so as to cover the whole surface of the pan</li>
        <li>Lay the <strong><em>salted and tempered</em></strong> steak in the pan, away from you</li>
        <li>About 2mins in take a peek underneath at the sear. If acceptable, flip it gently</li>

        <li>After about a minute, move the steak from the pan to a (warm) plate/ wooden chopping board. Pour the pan contents over the rested steak</li>
        <li>Let it rest for about 3-5mins</li>
        <li>Slice it <strong>against the grain</strong>. Serve and savour the absolute deliciousness!</li>
